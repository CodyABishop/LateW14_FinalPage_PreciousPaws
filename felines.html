					<h2>Felines</h2>
					<p>Cats by nature are a more distant kind of companion than dogs, often meeting you on their own terms as you go about your day. However, different cats all have unique behaviors, with some who are affectionate and cuddly rather than distant and judgemental. These kinds of behaviors are loosely categorized into a “Close | Distant” and “Affectionate | Reclusive” scale alongside any notes we include with the specific feline friend you’re meeting. These are designed so you can best match one to your unique family situation, be it a close companion for the kids, or a feline friend who sits quietly in the room while you read.</p>

					<h2>Medical and Temperment</h2>
					<p>Whether you’re an experienced friend of felines, or looking to meet your first feline friend, Precious Paws we’re sure to have just the cat for your home! All our cats have been fixed and have had all necessary medical checkups and shots, so the only hassle for you is deciding which ones you’re bringing home. All of our animals have medical papers, in addition to written details of the conditions they were found in that may help understand any strange temperaments.</p>

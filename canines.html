					<h2>Canines</h2>
					<p>Here at Precious Paws, we care for quite a few canine companions. First they’re nursed to health, all medical requirements such as shots are taken care of as part of their preparation process. In addition, all care for our canines are delivered using the most recent psychological study to minimize any aggression, and the animals are given ratings based on how they deal with situations and people so you can best identify who’s a good fit for your home.</p>

					<h2>Medical and Temperment</h2>
					<p>Dogs are a much more active style of pet than cats, who often need care like walks and play outside. In addition to the “Close | Distant” and “Affectionate | Reclusive” axes we rate cats with, dogs are further rated on “Excitable | Calm”. Some dogs are just so excited for attention they may jump around, and even with training could be a bit risky for small children. Other dogs are happy to let people hug on them, pet and play around without a care in the world. However, as said before, every dog is unique, and further described with individual notes of anything that scares, distresses; or even just makes them happy.</p>

					<h1>Precious Paws Animal Rescue</h1>
					<p>Here at the Precious Paws animal rescue, we’re committed to helping all sorts of furred friends find new homes. We have over five years experience now in caring for our rescued friends, and getting them back on the track to happiness. As part of this track, we are a strictly no-kill rescue that operates with the belief that every animal has a chance at a better life with the right home and care.</p>

					<h2>Info</h2>
					<p>At Precious Paws, while we’ve cared for many sorts of furred friends, we specialize in care and finding new homes for Cats and Dogs. Many of these animals were abandoned, mistreated, or donated as babies. This leads to a wide range of temperaments, with each animal receiving specialized care to best help them adjust to a more friendly and caring life ahead of them. As part of the adjustment process once they’re brought in, we examine what information we have of their circumstances alongside how they behave, and do our best to help them adjust to a new life. Careful therapy with people, training for lowered aggression over daily activities, and over time we’ve found nearly every animal comes to be as friendly as can be once you’ve understood them. From there, the animals are given ratings based on what they deal with well, and what can still be distressing to them, such as “Separation Anxiety” and “Aggressive while Eating”. These labels serve mainly as a way to understand that, for example, some cats wouldn’t do well in a house with a child that would pick them up; and some dogs wouldn’t handle a child hugging them in their sleep well either. </p>

					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p>Once you’ve found the perfect companion for your home, the adoption process is simple.Costs are kept to a bare minimum as our rescue is run from donations primarily. While you can choose to donate, it’s by no means a requirement, and the process for adoption as a whole is as quick and painless as can be. Look forward to meeting your perfect furred friend here!</p>
